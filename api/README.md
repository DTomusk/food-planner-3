# API 
The API is a Go server with a largely flat structure. It contains a cmd directory housing executables (currently just the server, but has room for things such as workers etc.) and an internal directory which has the application logic. 

Internal is divided into a number of packages, and there is little nesting beyond that. A domain package, such as recipe (currently the only one), is a vertical slice which contains entities, repos and services. The only layer that's segregated from these is the delivery layer which uses GraphQL generated by gqlgen, which favours a more centralised approach. So all resolvers regardless of domain live in gql, but this should be fine as resolvers are ideally very thin wrappers that simply delegate to domain services. 

Testing is done throughout with unit tests and integration tests. There are currently no mocks, instead repo and service tests use a real db instance in a docker container.
